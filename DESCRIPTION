Title: Array Operations for Arrays of Mismatching Sizes
Description: Support for implicit expansion of arrays in operations involving
    arrays of mismatching sizes. This pattern is known as "broadcasting" in
    'Python' and  "implicit expansion" in 'Matlab' and is explained for example in
    the article "Array programming with NumPy" by C. R. Harris et al. (2020)
    <doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2649-2>.
